Hey, it's my first C++ project. In the project I wrote a runtime environment for brainfuck.

I choose to use this as my first project since I already wrote a runtime for brainfuck in javascript (repo coming soon), and by this already have experience with brainfuck and the tricks needed for the runtime.


I hope it's not too bad ;)
